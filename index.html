              <h3>From NEET Aspirant to Full Stack Developer: My Journey</h3>
              <p>
                Life has a funny way of guiding us, sometimes in directions we
                never anticipated. After finishing high school, I had my sights
                set on a career in medicine. I decided to take a drop year to
                prepare for the NEET exam, dedicating all my time and energy to
                cracking it. However, things didn't go as planned. Despite my
                best efforts, the path to becoming a doctor didn't unfold as I
                had hoped.
              </p>

              <p>
                At that point, I had a choice to make: either stay stuck in
                disappointment or pivot and explore new opportunities. That's
                when I decided to attempt the West Bengal Joint Entrance
                Examination (WBJEE). Little did I know that this decision would
                lead me to a completely different but equally rewarding path
                engineering.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Entering the World of Engineering</h3>
              <p>
                When I got into an engineering college, everything was new and
                challenging, but also incredibly exciting. My initial focus was
                on mastering the basics: Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA),
                the core concepts of Computer Science, and the course curriculum
                laid out by the college. These foundational skills are crucial,
                but something more profound began to stir within me. While DSA
                is essential, it was the idea of building something of creating
                something tangible that truly excited me.
              </p>

              <p>
                I began to see coding not just as a set of instructions to be
                executed, but as a tool to bring ideas to life. It's like when a
                layperson walks down the street and sees a stunning car; they
                might say, “Wow, what a car!” But an engineer looks at that same
                car and thinks, “I could build something even better.” That's
                the mindset that started to take root in me.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Why Full Stack Development?</h3>
              <p>
                The more I delved into the world of coding, the more I realized
                that I wanted to be that engineer the one who could look at any
                software or application and say, “I can do this, and I can do it
                better.” This desire to not just understand but to create led me
                to Full Stack Development.
              </p>

              <p>
                Full Stack Development appealed to me because it's the perfect
                blend of creativity and technicality. It allows you to see the
                big picture and understand how every piece of the puzzle fits
                together, from the user interface to the backend logic. The idea
                of being able to build an entire application from scratch,
                seeing it come to life, and knowing that you created something
                functional and meaningful is incredibly fulfilling.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>The Road Ahead</h3>
              <p>
                Now, as I continue my journey, I'm more motivated than ever to
                push my limits. Every new project, every line of code, and every
                challenge I encounter is an opportunity to grow and improve.
                I've come to realize that success isn't always about sticking to
                the original plan; sometimes, it's about adapting, finding your
                passion, and going after it with everything you've got.
              </p>

              <p>
                Choosing Full Stack Development was one of the best decisions
                I've made, and I'm excited to see where this path will take me.
                Whether it's building innovative web applications or solving
                complex problems, I know that I'm on the right track, and I'm
                eager to continue exploring the endless possibilities that this
                field has to offer.

        <h2><u>Exploring Close to Home: My Local Adventures:</u></h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            While my journey as a full-stack developer keeps me busy, there's
            another passion that drives me—traveling. Although I haven't
            explored many places yet, the idea of hitting the road, discovering
            new spots, and immersing myself in different environments excites me
            deeply.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Shantiniketan: A Cultural Retreat</h3>

              <img
                src="Resources/shantiniketan.jpg"
                alt="Shantiniketan Image"
              />
              <p>
                Shantiniketan was my first real taste of travel. Known for its
                deep cultural roots and connection to Rabindranath Tagore, it's
                a place that feels like stepping back in time. Walking through
                the peaceful, tree-lined paths and seeing the blend of nature
                and art all around, I felt a sense of calm and inspiration. It's
                a place where creativity seems to flow naturally, and it left me
                with a newfound appreciation for art and culture.
              </p>

              <h3>Darjeeling: Twice as Nice</h3>
              <img src="Resources/darjeeling.jpg" alt="Darjeeling Image" />
              <p>
                Darjeeling has a special place in my heart, not just because
                I've been there twice, but because each trip offered something
                different. The first time was a typical visit—taking in the
                stunning views of the Mountains, sipping on world-famous tea,
                and exploring the charming hill town. But the second time, I
                made the journey on a motorcycle, and that changed everything.
                The thrill of navigating winding mountain roads with the crisp,
                cool air rushing past was exhilarating. It wasn't just about
                reaching the destination; it was about enjoying the journey
                itself.
              </p>

              <h3>Mandarmani: A Coastal Escape</h3>
              <img src="Resources/mandarmani.jpg" alt="Mandarmani Image" />
              <p>
                Mandarmani was my escape to the sea. The endless stretch of
                beach and the sound of waves crashing against the shore had a
                calming effect on me. It's a place where you can disconnect from
                the hustle and bustle of everyday life and just enjoy the simple
                pleasures—whether it's a quiet walk along the shore or watching
                the sunset over the water.

            <li>
              <h3>The Road Ahead</h3>
              <p>
                Though I haven't traveled far and wide, these local adventures
                have fueled my desire to see more. Each trip, whether to a
                cultural hub like Shantiniketan or the serene beaches of
                Mandarmani, has taught me that there's so much to discover, even
                close to home.
              </p>

              <p>
                Traveling excites me because it's not just about the places you
                visit, but the experiences you gather and the memories you
                create along the way. I'm eager to continue exploring, whether
                it's new destinations or revisiting old favorites with fresh
                eyes. There's a whole world out there, and I'm just getting
                started.

        <h2><u>Project Showcase:</u></h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            As part of my journey into web development, I've been working on
            projects that not only challenge me but also excite me as I bring
            ideas to life through code. Here's a glimpse into two projects I've
            been working on.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Sliding Sidebar with HTML and CSS</h3>
              <p>
                One of my recent projects was creating a sliding sidebar using
                just HTML and CSS. The idea was to make a user-friendly sidebar
                that could slide in and out of view, providing a clean and
                modern navigation experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                I used a simple yet clever approach by leveraging the checkbox
                input element. The checkbox acts as a toggle for the sidebar.
                When checked, the sidebar slides into view, and when unchecked,
                it slides out, all smoothly animated with CSS transitions. This
                project taught me the power of CSS for creating interactive
                elements without relying on JavaScript, and it was rewarding to
                see how a few lines of code could enhance the user experience.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Portfolio Website in Progress</h3>
              <p>
                Currently, I'm working on a more ambitious project: building my
                personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
                goal of this website is to showcase my skills, projects, and
                experiences in a way that reflects my journey as a developer.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm focusing on creating a responsive design that looks great on
                any device. The website will feature sections like an “About Me”
                page, a project gallery, and a contact form. I'm particularly
                excited about integrating JavaScript to add interactive
                elements, such as dynamic content loading and smooth scrolling
                effects. This project is a step up from my previous work, and
                it's helping me deepen my understanding of web development.
